## To Do

- ~~setup cmake project~~
- ~~import tet meshes~~
- visualizer code
- ~~figure out how rig parameters and rig Jacobian work~~
- mass matrix
- get physics code for gradient of energy `g`, hessian of energy `H`
- code energy function to find total FEM energy during line search
- code Newton's method/optimization to find complementary displacement `Uc`
